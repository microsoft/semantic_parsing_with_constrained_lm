        """
        Unbeknownst to Lark, the plan right hand sides of our SCFG grammar can contain sequences of expressions.
        To denote such sequences, we use a special token '"/"':

        create 2> "[x] = do the Event" "/" "describe ask create Event with [x].attendee at [x].startTime"

        Now suppose that you have an existing set of rules like:
        create 2> "describe ask create Event" with_event_modifier
        with_event_modifier 2> "with attendees \"Brian\""

        But now you also want to handle the example above. You _could_ write a new set of rules
        create_salient 2> "[x] = do the Event" "/" "describe ask create Event" with_salient_event_modifier
        with_salient_event_modifier 2> "with [x].attendee at [x].startTime"

        But suppose you already had N create rules, and you wanted to make all of them salient. You would have to
        make N more rules. This would make the grammar extremely bloated.

        Instead, what you would like to be able to do is write a single extra rule:
        with_event_modifier 2> "[x] = do the Event" "/" "with [x].attendee at [x].startTime"

        And our system should be able to automatically determine that "[x] = do the Event" should be generated first,
        before everything else.

        render_topological is a principled way of doing this. render_topological assumes that every
        right hand side actually specifies a One-Child-Policy DAG (OCPDAG) :TM:
        where every expression is a node, and each node's parent is the expression that came before it.

        For example,
        with_event_modifier 2> "[x] = do the Event" "/" "with [x].attendee at [x].startTime"

        defines a 2-node OCPDAG: "[x] = do the Event" -> "with [x].attendee at [x].startTime"

        When a rule X is used in a rule Y, we assume that the leaf node X gets substituted
        into the node representing the expression using X.

        For example,
        create 2> "describe ask create Event" with_event_modifier with_place
        with_event_modifier 2> "[x] = do the Event" "/" "with [x].attendee at [x].startTime"
        with_place 2> "[x] = do the Place" "/" "at [x]"
        defines a 3 node OCPDAG:
        "describe ask create Event" "with [x].attendee at [x].startTime"
        "do the Event" -> "describe ask create Event" "with [x].attendee at [x].startTime" "at [x]"
        "do the Place" -> "describe ask create Event" "with [x].attendee at [x].startTime" "at [x]"

        render_topological renders this graph in a topological order, with "/" added in between nodes.
        No guarantees are made about the exact ordering other than it's topological.

        See test_generated_node.py for a more complicated example.
